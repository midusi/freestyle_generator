Sunshine
Need you again baby girl
Between them legs baby girl

Make you come twice in a time, ey
Got you feeling so divine, yeah
Can not belive u's so fine-n

I don't know if she bonita
I just know that she on pay time
I just want some of that on me
I just want some of that sex time, mujer
Feel what I'm feeling? Yeah, feeling alone
Hitting the bitch with my dick
And that bitch me looking like she gone with the throne
I be in love with the bitch
Hoping she be in love when I'm gone
I'm in the need of the weed
Andi need you really chasing it with me oh
I never fuck with a clone
Smoking the shit super strong
So strong, got to sit oh
Hold on, wow, I be feeling lil too on yeah

Every time we speak
And my back be feeling weak
I be looking to your seat
And I feel the shit OG
Every time we speak
And my back be feeling weak
I just know that this shits cheep
Still I'm feeling you OG
Every time we speak
And my back be feeling weak
I just know that this shits cheep
Still im feeling you OG
