I thank all those people that pa 'here we drink
Those who listen and appreciate the work
To those above and those who are below
All special classes to the slums

I thank all who pa 'the show came
Hand raised, chanted and sang topics
Those who went to the point e 'sale and buy tickets
Or snapped in the door and someone passed

For all media pa 'program invited
Promoted the music, the other supported
My thanks goes pa 'all # # from the rlp
Flowgate for all, that wherever
Let me carry the ache, traveling and working
Also marked "aide"

Receiving flannel sheets, cards and accessories
Around the country marking territory here we go
Those who spread the word by networks
Put the information touches videos
And all you can, to all those shops
Beyond their discs were positioned, did sign them
Autographs and exploited it local

I thank the cities we always well received
Those living real rap, rap good caribbean
Lent to that space and sound
If it were not for the voice does not reach your ears

My thanks go pa 'all movement
Each passing year creates best talent
Event organizers, taking
Into account the genre and know that this is
At its best

A good if people put a grain of sand
And took another scene showing our rap as it sounds
If you will say the candela as relarela
This is the school that is giving that talk in venezuela
The!.. That culture is well respected out there
Everyone here see flag raps

Thanks to a day with me sat on the sidewalk
And told me that before I get off the stage agradeciera
Mere hear!, do not be so ungrateful, it cortez
Does not courageous and so I say goodbye
Here making a compliment for all the blessings
And congratulations on all the applause received

Thanks
Heart to those who truly

Pa 'that would also bacilen for your area
This is pa 'that thousands of people sing
Apa and the can with the pace hard detonates
That's what they say? My people going?
If the itch again and mine are in the house
Doing music pa 'races toditas
That we continue to talk and moving
Mass and hands rather high above the a
What I want is to see all my active people
Supporting the cause, positive mind
Everyone there in the audience shouting living
# # # Pa 'the new generation, flow directly
Venezuela # # #, the criminal rap that has no competition
Thanks you very much for congratulation
Tell me I let 'ta do if this' great
I think we're going to have to seed a non-weapon
While k-pu alla elavora me in the chair
Over here the other monitors in case someone catches us

Let pa run the track 'that this garment
And one who has no fear you turn
Who does not like it does not offend me that
There are rumors that the duo will be legend
